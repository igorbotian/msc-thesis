FINAL THESIS INSTRUCTIONS.

The actual research report is opened with an introduction. The purpose of the introduction is to
introduce the topic and awaken the reader's interest. The introduction briefly describes the
background, material extent and aims of the thesis. The introduction relates the thesis to other
research and sources and presents the research methodology applied. It also describes the key
points and organisation of the research report. It does not, however, include detailed descriptions 
of the theory, methods or results. A good introduction is, nevertheless, significantly longer than a
couple of pages, and is organised in a logical manner.
