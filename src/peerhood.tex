HOW TO ORGANIZE YOUR THESIS

A brief section giving background information may be necessary, especially if your work spans two or
more traditional fields. That means that your readers may not have any experience with some of the 
material needed to follow your thesis, so you need to give it to them. 
A different title than that given above is usually better; e.g., "A Brief Review of Frammis Algebra."
