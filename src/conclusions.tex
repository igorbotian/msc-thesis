FINAL THESIS INSTRUCTIONS.

Depending on the nature and scope of the study, the report ends either with the chapter
"Conclusions", or two separate chapters, e.g. "Conclusions" and "Summary". The conclusions
analyse the observations and results drawn from the research. The conclusions examine and reflect
on e.g. the compatibility of the theory and measurements, the reasons for possible differences, and
summarise the conclusions drawn from the results. The need for further research and possible
practical applications may also be argued here.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR WRITING A MASTER'S THESIS

In most cases it is reasonable to present new findings and main results in a separate
section. This section also further analyzes observations and results. This section is also the
place to include the synthesis of the results, the future possibilities in the research topic or
the in the application area. After discussion and consideration one should present the
conclusions. This section contains the reasoning for those conclusions. In the next section,
in the summary, one just lists the conclusions.
