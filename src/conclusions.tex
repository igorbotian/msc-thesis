FINAL THESIS INSTRUCTIONS.

Depending on the nature and scope of the study, the report ends either with the chapter
"Conclusions", or two separate chapters, e.g. "Conclusions" and "Summary". The conclusions
analyse the observations and results drawn from the research. The conclusions examine and reflect
on e.g. the compatibility of the theory and measurements, the reasons for possible differences, and
summarise the conclusions drawn from the results. The need for further research and possible
practical applications may also be argued here.
