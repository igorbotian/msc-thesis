\todo{Abstract}
\begin{remarks}
\\
The abstract is a concise (one A4 sheet), objective, independent summary
of the Masterâ€™s thesis. It should be intelligible as such, without the original document. 
It explains the contents of the thesis: the objective, methodologies, results and conclusions. 
A good abstract is written in complete and concise sentences. 
The author does not express his or her opinions, but describes the thesis as would an outside reporter. 
No direct references are made to the original text. 
\\
The abstract is a public document, and therefore all confidential information must be excluded
from it. The abstract is prepared in Finnish and English. 
Both the Finnish and English abstracts are included in the thesis. 
\\
The abstracts are also submitted to the faculty study affairs services as an annex to the assessment 
application of the thesis.
Foreign nationals do not need to prepare an abstract in Finnish.
\\
The author sends electronic copies of the abstracts or the entire thesis to the LUT library. 
More details are available from the library and its web site.
