\begin{description}
	\item[Device discovery]. System must be able to discovery other PeerHood capable devices 
		within range and the same device neighborhood.
		\Sentence
		Device detection can be depend used network technology.

		\item[Service discovery]. System must be able to discovery services from the local device 
		and other PeerHood devices in the device neighborhood.
		\Sentence
		System must have capability to read service attributes as well with service discovery.

		\item[Service sharing]. PeerHood must provide mechanism to register services and use them 
		by applications or middleware components. 
		\Sentence
		Services can locate on local or remote device. 
		\Sentence
		The PeerHood system must advertise registered services to other devices in a PeerHood 
		neighborhood.

		\item[Connection establishment]. PeerHood must provide ability of connect to one or more 
		other PeerHood device in a PeerHood neighborhood. 
		\Sentence
		Connect establishment must be transparent for used underlying network technology.

		\item[Active monitoring of a device]. PeerHood must provide way to set a selected device 
		in the PeerHood neighborhood under active monitoring. 
		\Sentence
		In the active monitoring state, a PeerHood client is notified when the device under 
		monitoring is out of range or when it comes back in the range. 
		\Sentence
		Proper response time and range are network technology dependent attributes.

		\item[Data transmission between devices]. PeerHood must provide data transmission between 
		connected PeerHood devices. 
		\Sentence
		PeerHood should not take care of data being transferred. 
		\Sentence
		User of the PeerHood must take care of data endianess and word length of data.

		\item[Seamless connectivity]. PeerHood should provide way to change used active network 
		technology automatically if established connection weakens or breaks. 
		\Sentence
		PeerHood should provide always the best possible connections for the user. 
		\Sentence
		Established connection should be possible to monitoring for detecting connection changes, 
		which might cause change of used network technology.

		\item[Network management]. PeerHood should be able to manage a specific network and events 
		from the network. 
		\Sentence
		In addition, PeerHood should check availability of network and get notifications of changes 
		of the network.

		\item[Component management]. PeerHood should provide events to PeerHood client of changes 
		and suspensions of discovering functionalities. 
		\Sentence
		The PeerHood operates on mobile devices where memory and power consumptions have to take 
		care. 
		\Sentence
		Due to that, used device environment is dynamic. 
		\Sentence
		As, if network interface might go power saving state or it can be closed for freeing memory 
		to other applications.

		\item[Communication concurrency base]. PeerHood must support concurrent execution, in that 
		multiple connections are used and they need to get execution time evenly. 
		\Sentence
		The only exception for use of multiple simultaneous connections is if used network 
		technology limits multiple connections on the hardware level.

		\item[Event interface]. PeerHood must provide event interface for be able to notify 
		dynamic changes to PeerHood client and itself.

		\item[Plugin architecture for networks]. PeerHood must provide interface for its 
		functionalities to plugins. 
		\Sentence
		Network plugins implements abstractions of connectivity and device monitoring 
		functionalities. 
		\Sentence
		In addition, plugins handles device detection and service sharing.

		\item[User control]. PeerHood could provide ability to control PeerHood functionalities
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Is PeerHood active
			\item What services are provided
			\item What services are accepted
		\end{enumerate}

		This is a new requirement and that is not yet implemented in the existing PeerHood 
		implementation.
