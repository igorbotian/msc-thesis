\Paragraph{Which software security vulnerabilities PeerHood contains}
%
PeerHood security analysis showed that the project contains security vulnerabilities. 
%
These are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	%\leftskip2em%
	\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}%
	%\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}%

	\item non-safe access rights assigned to the configuration file
	\item lack of security mechanisms
	\item data is transferred between devices in unencrypted form
	\item information about hostname and identifier of a device is transmitted during communication between devices
	\item violation of PeerHood \Abbreviation{API} classes encapsulation
	\item lack of input data checking in all entry points of the project
\end{itemize}

\Paragraph{Are PeerHood functional characteristics violated}
%
The fact that PeerHood contains the security vulnerabilities listed above influences on it's functioning. 
%
It may lead to violation of the following PeerHood functional characteristics: 
\begin{itemize}
	%\leftskip2em%
	\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}%
	%\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}%

	\item data transferability between devices
	\item confidentiality and integrity of transferred data

	\item availability, confidentiality, and integrity of up-to-date information about devices in the network environment
	\item possibility of user data exchange and exchange of information about available devices in the network environment

	\item availability, confidentiality, and integrity of up-to-date information about available services in the network environment
	\item possibility of exchange between devices of information about available services in the network environment

	\item possibility of user data transfer between devices
	\item confidentiality and integrity of user data transferred between devices
\end{itemize}

\Paragraph{Violation of security principles and security requirements to PeerHood}
%
Violation of the functional characteristics listed above leads to violation of all components of PeerHood security: integrity, availability, and confidentiality. 
%
This in turn leads to apperance of a threat to violation of functional requirements to PeerHood. 

\Paragraph{PeerHood goals violation}
%
Thus, violation of functional requirements to PeerHood leads to appearance of threats to non-conformances \T{of} the project goals. 
%
And this in turn negatively influences on it's fault-tolerance. 
%
Thus one can concludes that PeerHood is non-secure software.
