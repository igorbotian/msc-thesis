\Paragraph{What is a software security threat}
%
According to the RFC 4949 \Reference{RFC4949}, threat is a potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security and cause harm. 
%
That is, a threat is a possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability

\Paragraph{Classification}
%
Security threat may become apparent on any stage of software development lifecycle. 
%
This fact is used for classification of software security threats based on their origin. 
%
According to the classification, threats are divided by the following categories \Reference{Winograd2008}: 
\begin{description}
	\item[Unintentional] It can be ignoring secure programming practices, failure to take into account security on deployment stage of development lifecycle, invalid requirement to a project from the security point of view. 
	\item[Intentional but not malicious] It can be absence of input data check.
	\item[Malicious] It can be intentional developing of a backdoor in an application, use of a default password, possibility of a penetration attack. 
\end{description}

\Paragraph{Transition to attacks}
%
Software can not be considered as a safe one if it has a security vulnerability. 
%
Even if security threat is found, the fact leads to possibility of an attack carrying out by a malicious person.
